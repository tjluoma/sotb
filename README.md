Tumblr's API v2 requires OAuth.

This script is designed to help you.

**Fair Warning:** This isn't easy. At least, not initially. But once you have it setup the first time, the rest of it will be fairly easy.

Also, please note that as of 2012-09-11, all this does is post text posts to Tumblr. More will (may?) come later.

Also note that this script relies on <https://github.com/decklin/curlicue> and <https://gist.github.com/2603387>.

Versions of those have been copied into this repository. Forgive me if that's not the 'proper' way to do this, I'm new to the ways of git, especially etiquette and protocol, I just wanted to make sure they were available in case the originals disappear.
